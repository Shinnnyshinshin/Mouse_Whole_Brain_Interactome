## Mouse_Whole_Brain_Interactome

Interactome was reverse engineered with ARACNe from a mouse whole brain expression dataset (437 samples, GSE10415). ARACNe was run with 100 bootstrap iterations using all probes that mapped to a set of 1,507 mouse transcriptional regulators (defined as genes annotated in the Gene Ontology Molecular Function database as GO:0003700 - ‘transcription factor activity’) for the human dataset. Parameters were set to 0 DPI tolerance and a MI P value threshold (P<10-7), as recommended for bootstrap ARACNe analysis of a dataset with this size, to achieve a Bonferroni corrected significance (P = 0.05) for getting a single false-positive in the dataset.
